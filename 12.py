Problem: List Commands

You are given an empty list, arr = [].

Your task is to read a number n (the total number of commands),
and then read n lines of commands. Each command will be one of the following:

âœ… List of Valid Commands:
    insert i e â€“ Insert integer e at position i
    print â€“ Print the list
    remove e â€“ Delete the first occurrence of integer e
    append e â€“ Insert integer e at the end of the list
    sort â€“ Sort the list in ascending order
    pop â€“ Remove the last element from the list
    reverse â€“ Reverse the list

ðŸ”„ Input Format:
    The first line contains an integer n, the number of commands.
    The next n lines each contain a command from the list above.

ðŸ“¤ Output Format:
    For every print command, print the list on a new line.

âœ… Constraints:
    The elements added to the list will be integers.
    All commands are guaranteed to be valid and in the correct format.

ðŸ§ª Sample Input:
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print

ðŸ“¤ Sample Output:
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
